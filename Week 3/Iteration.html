<h1>Python Reading</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read the chapter entitled <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">More About Iteration</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>for</b> loop
<ul>
<li>Know how to use <b>range</b></li>
<li>Know how to iterate over a string (e.g. "Bozeman High") or 
    a list (e.g. [1, "Potato", 2, "Potato"])
</ul>
<li><b>while</b> loop</li>
<li>Know how to nest one loop inside of another</li>
</ul>

<h2>Active Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a Python program that generates a random number between
    1 and 10.  The program should repeatedly ask the user to guess what
    the number is until the user guesses correctly.  When the user
    guesses correctly, the program should print a message that
    shows how many tries it took.  For example, the message might
    be <i>Congratulations!  That took 6 guesses.</i><br /><br /></li>
<li>Write a Python program that asks the user to enter two integers:
    one for the number of rows and one for the number of columns.  The
    program should then produce a text-based drawing where each position in the
    drawing is randomly determined with equal probability to be 
    either a "*" or a "-".  For example, with 4 rows and 6 columns, the
    drawing might look like this:
<pre>
**-*-*
--**--
-*--*-
---*-*
</pre>  
</li>
<li>Python has two keywords that are relevant to loops: <b>continue</b>
    and <b>break</b>.  Determine what they do by experimenting 
    with <a href="loop.py">loop.py</a>.  <i>Note: Try to avoid using
    these two Python constructs.  Typically, there is a better way to
    solve the problem.</i></li>
</ul>
